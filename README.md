A Hash Table implementation in C++

This is a speedy implementation of a Hash Table in C++

It uses separate chaining with Dan J Bernstein's djb2 algorithm for the hash function.

Simply run `make` to generate the a.out executable, then run the executable with the desired dictionary in the first parameter, then the desired word puzzle in the second parameter. The output will be all the words found.
